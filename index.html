			<h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>I was introduced to Graphic Design back in middle school when I took a course in computer graphics. At that time Photoshop Elements 2.0 came out, and it got me hooked right away. The ability to manipulate photos and create new design was something I have never seen before. The possibilities seemed endless. I purchased a copy of Photoshop Elements 2.0 right away, and looked for tutorials to teach myself. As I learned more and more about Graphic Design, it became something that I wanted to pursue as a career. And with the support from my parents, I was able to chase my dream.</p>
